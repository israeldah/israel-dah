    <h2>Evangelis Israel Dah</h2>
    <p>Hey, my name is Evangelis and I come from Ivory coast. I am 22 years old and still single haha! Since I was young I have always been wondering how computers and the internet work.
        I had in mind that they were too challenging to comprehend. As I was growing up I became friend with social media, Youtube being my favorite.
        I have learned so much from many different topics and my desire to learn more and more increased. Now I want to challenge myself and take web and computer 
        programming courses and learn about what I always thought to be difficult to comprehend.</p>
    <p>I have a lot of hobbies namely playing soccer, basketball, reading, drawing, listenning to music and playing musical instruments like piano, guitare, flute and the trumpet.</p>
    I am all excited about getting to know each of my classmates. Thank you for looking at my first web page.
